# Backlog — open work

Durable and deferred work. This is the long list; the **active cut** — what is
queued or in-flight right now — lives in `docs/STATE.md` (§Queued, §In-flight)
and is authoritative for the current branch. When an item here becomes the next
thing worked, it moves into STATE.md §Queued.

## Deferred / parked
- **dnd-kit `SortableContext`** — parked. Pointer-vs-rect (`computeInsertIndex`)
  was chosen instead, no model change. Revisit only if pointer-vs-rect proves
  insufficient. (See STATE.md §Parked.)

## Someday / unscheduled
- **`reorderWaypoints` was dead — deleted in STEP 2; id-based only if a consumer
  returns.** The index-based `reorderWaypoints` (repo) + `reorderWaypointsAction`
  pair had NO consumer (live drag-reorder goes through `node-actions`/`localRanks`
  fractional `placeRanks`, not waypoint-index splice). Both were deleted rather
  than converted, removing a conflict-class (b) `refuse` path entirely instead of
  fixing it. IF a waypoint-reorder consumer is ever added: implement it id-based
  ("move waypoint X before waypoint Y"), NEVER index-based — position-splice
  corrupts against any changed list (a stale client view reorders the wrong pair),
  and id-based lands in class (a) so its write can `retry`/compose. Same lesson as
  `placeRanks` being keyed by placeId, not position.
- **Wizard form-actions can't surface `TRIP_CONFLICT`** — the four void
  `writeWizardSlice` callers in `plan/actions.ts` (`addStopAction`,
  `removeStopAction`, `saveStopsAction`, `toggleSuggestionAction`) are consumed as
  `<form action={…}>` server actions returning `void`, so a `refuse` conflict has
  no return channel. `addStop`/`removeStop`/`toggleSuggestion` stay on-page and the
  trailing `revalidatePath` re-reads fresh state, so a dropped edit shows as absent
  and the user retries.
- **KNOWN LOSSY PATH — `saveStopsAction` silently drops the `avoidHighways`
  toggle on a `refuse` conflict.** Unlike its stay-on-page siblings, it `redirect`s
  to the loader after the write, so a conflict advances the wizard having dropped
  the toggle with no signal. Do NOT call this benign: it only looks harmless at
  today's 9 single-owner trips — exactly the light-usage reasoning the `version`
  column exists to stop relying on. Fix: convert the stops page to `useActionState`
  so the `refuse` conflict has a return channel and surfaces `TRIP_CHANGED_ERROR`
  (same treatment the three `FormState` wizard steps already got).
- **Reference trips render a remove ✕ that always fails** — the read spine shows
  the ✕ on waypoint tiles for reference trips too, but `removeWaypointAction` on a
  slug hits the in-memory `TRIPS` fixture (`repository.ts:184`), misses a DB-only
  reference trip, and returns *"Could not remove stop."* A visible control that
  cannot work. Reference trips are read-only templates (fork-to-edit), so the ✕
  should not render on them. Fix: pass `isReference` from `trip-slideup-body.tsx`
  into `DayDetailCorridorColumn` (`:337` currently omits it) and gate the remove
  control on `!isReference`. (Separate from the frozen-trip *server* guard, which
  is now `checkNotFrozen`.)
- **`applyPlaceOverrides`: insert by mile, not append** — today a re-homed place is
  appended to its node's `placeIds` (`bucket.ts:112-122`), so "server order" is mile
  order for auto-bucketed picks but pin order for overridden ones. That makes an
  unranked cluster's display order depend on pin sequence. Inserting the override at
  its along-route mile instead would make server order == mile order everywhere, so
  unranked display order stops depending on how you pinned. Touches verified
  attachment code (`bucketPlacesIntoCorridor`/`applyPlaceOverrides`) — needs the
  Phase-1 bucketing re-verification, not a drive-by.

- **`CATEGORY_COMPATIBILITY` has no keys for `restaurant`, `grocery`,
  `car_repair`** (`data/entity-resolution/matcher.ts:162-201`). With the
  google_resolved category fix landed, food/grocery resolutions now carry a
  correct *stored* `primary_category`, but `lookupCompatibility` returns 0 for
  those categories, so they can never `name_dominant`/auto-link and accumulate
  as isolated `master_place` rows (one per resolution, no dedup). Given how much
  itinerary content is food, extending the matrix (add restaurant/grocery/
  car_repair rows + cross-compat to any OSM/pipeline equivalents) is worth
  scoping. Not in the google_resolved-category PR.

- **`materialize`'s final Typesense-sync stage fails (DNS `ENOTFOUND`) from a
  network-restricted context** — the DB stages (entity resolution + promotion)
  run and commit FIRST, then the last stage syncs `*.typesense.net`. From a
  sandboxed/egress-restricted environment that host doesn't resolve, so the run
  exits non-zero AFTER the corpus writes have landed: `master_place` is updated
  but the search index is NOT. Net effect — a `materialize` run from a
  restricted context leaves **Typesense stale** (DB and index diverge) while
  reporting failure. Mitigations today: run `materialize` from a machine that
  can reach `*.typesense.net`, or run `npm run -w data search:sync` separately
  afterward to reconcile the index. Worth scoping: make the sync stage a
  distinct, separately-resumable step (or a preflight reachability check) so a
  DB-successful run isn't reported as a total failure and the index gap is
  explicit. Surfaced 2026-07-23 during the google_resolved end-to-end proof.

- **No dev sign-in path — verifying any authed browser surface needs a hand-minted
  cookie every time.** The UI offers Google OAuth only, and TEST has no Google
  provider configured, so exercising a `canEdit`/RLS surface in a real browser means
  minting a Supabase SSR session server-side and injecting the cookie by hand — a
  throwaway script each session (done again during the NL flag-split verify, PR #126).
  Options: a dev-only `/auth/dev-login` route, or a committed helper script that mints
  and prints the cookie. The route is cleaner. Its guard MUST be the TEST-ref check
  (the same `ref !== znldzjdatkogdktymtvi` gate `checkRails` uses), NOT a flag — so it
  is structurally incapable of existing in prod, flag misconfiguration notwithstanding.

- **`find_master_place_candidates` is not exercised end-to-end by the ER corpus
  run** — the phase3a D4 `beforeAll` calls `reset_phase3a_test_state`, leaving
  `master_place` empty, so `matchAll` runs in `skipRpcs` rematerialize mode
  (`matcher.ts` — RPC skipped, candidates come from in-memory
  `plannedMasterPlaces`). The populated-`master_place` PostGIS candidate lookup
  is therefore covered only by `matcher.test.ts` mocks and the 3b synthetic
  `recompute` (a different RPC), never by a real populated-corpus `matchAll`.
  **Pre-existing** — true of the old prod-derived seed too, NOT introduced by the
  pinned-fixture change (docs/decisions/2026-07-23-pinned-er-fixture.md). Worth a
  dedicated test that seeds a small resolved corpus (non-empty `master_place`)
  and runs an incremental `matchAll(delta)` so the RPC path runs for real.

- **`enrich.ts` HONESTY PASS — the trip-waypoint detail panel still fabricates**
  (`web/src/lib/trips/enrich.ts`). The detail-honesty pass (#85) made the
  browse/search path into the slide-up panel honest — `browsePlaceToWaypoint`
  surfaces every field real or absent. The OTHER path into the SAME panel — a
  trip waypoint already added to a day, enriched via `enrichWaypoint` — was
  deliberately left untouched and still invents, per the "Guisados"-card
  comparison: the reliability score ("81 GOOD RELIABILITY / computed from 2
  sources" is `75 + hash(slug,…)` / `2 + hash(slug,…)`, not computed); the "IF
  YOU STOP HERE" stop time (heuristic 45m); a ~$15–25 entrée (canned per
  category via `ENTRY_BY_CATEGORY`); planned/with-stop ETAs and "arrive at St.
  George at 1:20 PM" (hardcoded/derived); "DAY 2 UNAFFECTED" (asserted); and
  Local Eats / Sit-down / Cash-OK tags + the DATA SOURCES trio (the slug-hashed
  `*_BY_CATEGORY` maps — which even list `iOverlander`, a banned source). This
  violates the grounding invariant (every field real or absent) on a surface
  users see, so it ranks HIGHER than its age suggests. **THE FORK — record
  both, do not pick:** (a) strip the fabrication so trip-waypoint cards match
  the honest browse cards — consistent and honest, but thinner; (b) keep the
  rich "if you stop here" impact layout and rebuild it on REAL routing data —
  real detour and arrival impact, now feasible with Mapbox routing (the same
  routing the directions panel uses). Under (b) the reliability score and canned
  tags would still need real backing or stay out.

- **FED-MERGE LIVE-PROVENANCE GAP — merged live rows lose their DATA SOURCES
  section** (`web/src/lib/trip-browse/merge-corpus.ts`). `mergeCorpusIntoPool`
  folds the federated corpus into a day's live-discovered pool via a coord+name
  `sameSpot` match; on a match CORPUS WINS and only `photoUrl`/`photoAlt` are
  backfilled from the live twin — NOT `mention.secondary`. When the winning
  corpus row (`mapMasterPlaceRow`) has null/empty `attribution`, its `secondary`
  is `""` (`federated.ts:176`), so `realDataSources` (`card-stats.ts:191`)
  returns `[]` and the panel's DATA SOURCES section is omitted entirely — even
  though the matched live row carried real provenance ("Google ·
  OpenStreetMap"). Honest (absent provenance → no section, not fabrication) but
  a real gap, and the most prod-visible of these: the corpus fold feeds
  `day.segmentSuggestions`. Fix: on a corpus-wins match, backfill `mention`
  (and/or `attribution`/`overlanderTags`) from the live twin the same way the
  photo already is. Note: the note that surfaced this filed it under
  `USE_FEDERATED_POIS`; the verified provenance-drop is in the
  `USE_FEDERATED_CORRIDOR` corpus fold (`plan/actions.ts:216-233`) — the
  browse-route `USE_FEDERATED_POIS` merge is purely additive
  (`[...liveTagged, ...federated]`) and does NOT drop live provenance.

- **GPS-ORIGIN LABEL on the no-GPS directions fallback**
  (`web/src/components/trip/directions-panel.tsx:126`). For a route-to-place
  search result (`dayRelative === false`), the route origin is
  `routeTo ? position ?? legStart : legStart` — with no GPS fix it silently
  falls back to the day-start (`legStart`), yet the panel presents a live "from
  now" arrival ETA (`:49`, `:230-233`) that frames the route as departing from
  the user's current position. Nothing labels the origin as the day-start
  rather than "here," so the no-GPS case (the common web-planning case — noted
  as such at `:195`) mislabels where the route starts. Small, cosmetic,
  honest-labelling issue. Fix: label the origin when it's the day-start fallback
  (i.e. when `position` is null), so the route/ETA don't imply a live-location
  departure that isn't happening.

- **Live-weather integration — RESCUABLE from PR #24 (salvage, not rebase).** OpenMeteo
  forecast + climatology fallback (`src/lib/weather/` + `src/lib/trips/resolve-weather.ts`)
  is a genuine unmerged feature: **ABSENT from main** — only the `Day.weather` placeholder
  field exists, not the live fetch. PR #24 sits ~400 commits behind; **do NOT rebase it**
  (it would fight 400 commits of drift). Rescue by SALVAGE: lift the weather lib and
  re-wire it into `DayBriefingCard` — its original hook `suggested-section.tsx` was
  deleted in the 2026-07-12 one-day-renderer refactor. Kept open as PR #24 with the same
  note; this entry is what keeps it from reading as a dead stale PR. (Triage 2026-07-24.)

- **Finish reference-fixture removal** (follow-up to the getTrip DB-first flip,
  branch `refactor/reference-trips-db-first`). The flip made reference trips
  serve from `reference_trips`; the `TRIPS` fixture no longer shadows the DB but
  the reference literals still sit in the module. To fully remove them: empty
  `seed()` of the reference literals, reroute `ensureAlaskaUpgraded`'s 4
  waypoint-helper callers (`repository.ts:94,108,120,181`, which read
  `TRIPS["la-to-deadhorse"]`) to the DB reader, then delete `ensureAlaskaUpgraded`,
  and drop `la-to-portland` from `FIXTURE_TRIPS` in
  `api/trip-browse/[tripId]/[dayId]/route.ts` (so it goes live/federated instead
  of the curated `BROWSE_PLACES` catalog — verify the browse path still resolves).
  **Open question that decides its size (investigate before scoping):** are those
  4 helpers pure lookups, or does any back a WRITE? A DB reader returns a fresh
  object, so rerouting a write path silently no-ops. **Likely wants to land with
  or after the remove-✕ affordance gating** — same in-memory write paths. Do NOT
  bundle on tired assumptions; every dig this session found another coupling.
  Note: `TRIPS` must SURVIVE this — it is also the anon-wizard store (below).
  **DOC:** this removes the "4 residual `ensureAlaskaUpgraded` reads" and the
  "literals still sit in `TRIPS`" claims — update
  `docs/architecture/trip-resolution.md` (§ `TRIPS`' current role) in the same PR.
- **`TRIPS` is the anon-wizard persistence layer** (not just reference fixtures).
  `createTrip` (`plan/actions.ts:786`, anon finalize, gated `ENABLE_PLANNER_WIZARD`)
  writes `trip-<8char>` drafts into the `globalThis`-pinned `TRIPS` store;
  `listAnonTrips` lists them (`id.startsWith("trip-")`); the repository slug-write
  paths edit them; `getTrip` resolves them (last, after the DB reference readers).
  Ephemeral — lost on server restart, never persisted to Supabase. Not part of the
  reference-trip migration; recorded so the next person doesn't mistake it for
  dead fixture code. Deleting the `TRIPS` module would remove this feature.
